# Uncomment to write to enable secure-boot by writing. This
# locks the device to the public key in the EEPROM by storing the
# sha256 hash of the public key in OTP.

# This option also prevents the ROM from loading recovery.bin from SD/EMMC
# which means that the bootloader can only be updated via RPIBOOT or self-update.

# Uncomment program_pubkey=1 to enable this
# WARNING: THIS OPTION MODIFIES THE BCM2712 CHIP AND IS IRREVERSIBLE.

# N.B The revoke_keydey option is not required and not currently implemented
# because on 2712 the bootloader firmware must also be signed by the customer
# key if secure-boot is enabled.
